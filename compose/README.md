# Running just the storeMoM.sh file inside the container using command "docker-compose run scripts bash" would store the mom in MySql database AlphaQMoM. It might take a little longer than usual but it works completely fine if tried after a particular process of preparing the socket and server with 3306 port is over and this is the process that takes a while (took around 3 mins after pulling the images and it can be checked in the log). Trying to login to MySQL in any of the docker containers before that process might return an error.
